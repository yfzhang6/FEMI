Enhanced Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for Dense Object Detection in Power Switchgear Using FEMI-YOLOv8


#### Abstract

Power switchgear plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of power systems. Accurate and real-time detection of switchgear conditions is essential for maintaining grid stability. However, existing detection models often struggle with complex environments and the densely distributed indicators on switchgear cabinets. To address these challenges, this study proposes an improved model called FEMI-YOLOv8, based on the YOLOv8 architecture. FEMI-YOLOv8 introduces partial convolution in the backbone network to augment C2f and combines it with a lightweight multi-scale attention module (EMA) to form a new structure, C2f-Faster-EMA, reducing model complexity and increasing speed. Furthermore, a multi-branch assisted fusion (MAFPN) is designed to effectively integrate spatial information, enhancing small target recognition. The loss function is also improved by incorporating Inner-MPD-IoU, which further optimizes the regression results. Experimental results demonstrate that FEMI-YOLOv8 achieves meritorious detection performance in power switchgear, with an average accuracy of 92.4%, a model size of 5.0MB, and an inference speed of 125 FPS. The improved algorithm offers high detection accuracy with a small model size, making it suitable for deployment on mobile devices and enabling efficient and accurate real-time detection of switchgear.
